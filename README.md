# GeoMod

## Overview 

GEOmetric MODular Kernel

GeoMod is a self-contained, fully cross-platform modular kernel
for use in any environment that handles 3D and 2D graphics.
It is designed around a modular architecture that results 
in a highly flexible, configurable and powerful system.

This repository contains the source code for the GeoMod core kernel,
which is intended as the base for custom implementations of model
generators, physics systems and rendering systems etc. There are,
however, some simple example modules implemented for the purpose
of demonstration and learning.
