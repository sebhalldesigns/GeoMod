//
//  --- Features ---
//
//  geomod is a hybrid geometric kernel, designed for 
//  both solid-style modelling, (e.g mechanical CAD) as 
//  well as mesh-style modelling (e.g animation, game 
//  design). It also features a heirarchical layout
//  system, as well as advanced model loading and rendering. 
//  Intended applications include mechanical and 
//  architectural CAD software, animation design and
//  surface modelling applications.
